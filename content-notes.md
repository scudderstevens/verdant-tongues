## Rethinking Spaces :: Reshapping Mental Norms

"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them." - Albert Einstein

Re-Envisioned our surroundings will provide opportunities for new insights to the same old problems. Physical space as a catalyist to mental change. A collective metal space where we address problems preventing us from reaching the next level of human co-evolution.

### Humanity 2.0

Climate Change, Global Pandemics and who knows - we are here. Like it or not the unfamiliar is now our collective *normal*. 

**Kardashev Scale** transition from type Zero (0) to One (1), [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) | [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DXtpibqvFfE?t=2730)

Humanity will be hard pressed to continue in current state of *normal*. We ultimatly need to transition to a susstainable, post-scarcity economy and truly egalitarian society.

### Mental Space, Solar Punk

"There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so." - William Shakespeare

No singular Solarpunk vision but possibly in a world where blame is pointless in a world of collective responsibility. The collective struggle to solve the problem is king. A greener and more optimistic future, the manifesto [www](https://hieroglyph.asu.edu/2014/09/solarpunk-notes-toward-a-manifesto/)
